# recorder
An in-game recorder script to assist with hydra stunt videos for [Sky Warriors](https://skywarriors.net)

## Commands (this is due to change)
- /recording load [filename] - load a recording file into memory
- /recording start [filename] - starts new recording or resumes currently stopped recording with option to set predefined filename
- /recording stop - stops current recording
- /recording clear - destroy recording and clear up memory
- /recording seek [frame.no] - seek to specific frame
- /recording save - save recording to file
- /recording play - start playing

## TODO
- [] separate recording container from player / recorder
- [] improve recorder / player FPS sync (it's a bit jittery)
